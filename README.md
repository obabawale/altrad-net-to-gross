# Altrad Payroll: Net To Gross To Net

## Problem Statement

We have a situation where we are able to determine the gross pay of regular employees (EMP) starting with their basic salary. The equation for that is typically:

Net = Gross - Deductions

Where Gross is equivalent to:

Gross = Basic + Allowances [+ Bonuses] where bonuses are optional (You may/may not have bonuses).

However, for Freelancers (FLC), we know the Net pay but not other factors of their salary. and need to be able to work up from the Net to get the Gross and the deductions as well as everything in between.

## Steps

1. - [x] Come up with a quadratic function that can be minized to get the Gross Income value
2. - [ ] Write code for the quadractic function
3. - [ ] Add minimization package to run on the code
